NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1 Usability

The system shall support Vietnamese UI (English optional).

The UI shall be responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Common tasks (Find Station → Book → Pay) shall be completable in ≤ 3 clicks from the home screen for an authenticated Driver.

Error messages shall be clear and actionable (no raw stack traces).

2 Reliability

Data entered into the system shall be saved persistently, even in the event of a sudden shutdown or network failure.

Booking and payment operations shall be atomic and idempotent (retries must not double-book or double-charge).

Temporary integration failures (e.g., payment) shall be retried and reconciled automatically within a configurable window.

Service availability shall be ≥ 99.5% monthly, excluding planned maintenance.

3 Performance

Response time for loading the station list with availability shall be ≤ 2 seconds (P95) under normal network conditions.

Response time for confirming a booking shall be ≤ 3 seconds (P95).

Response time for loading a user profile/history shall be ≤ 2 seconds (P95).

Generating standard reports (daily revenue, swap count for last 30 days) shall be ≤ 5 seconds.

4 Supportability

The system shall follow a modular, layered architecture to support future enhancements (e.g., adding new functions/entities).

Business rules (pricing, booking hold timeout, cancellation/no-show windows) shall be configuration-driven without code changes.

Public APIs shall be versioned (e.g., /v1) to ease evolution and integration.

Centralized logging and error tracking shall be provided to support troubleshooting and maintenance.
